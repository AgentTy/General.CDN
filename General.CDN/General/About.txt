General.CDN relies on a few classes that exist in the General namespace, but are not in this project.

Current dependencies include...
	- General.Model.URL
	- General.Model.JsonObject
	- StringFunctions

The General DLL is included in the Externals folder for this solution, so you can reference it.
Alternatively you could checkout and reference the General library in the General.CDN projects.

General lives here...
