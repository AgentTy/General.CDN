General.CDN relies on a few classes that exist in the General namespace, but are not in this project.

Current dependencies include...
	- General.Model.URL
	- General.Model.JsonObject
	- General.Web.MimeTypeMap
	- StringFunctions

In order to minimize dependencies, I've copied the above classes into this project and placed them in the General.CDN namespace. 
You will not need to reference General in order to use General.CDN. It's ugly, but I'll just have to keep them in sync manually.

General lives here...
